After 3-4 months of work my app is finally done! Can you guess what personality I set in the screenshot below to critique my data today? 

~Introducing AiFitnessCoach The first ever Ai agent macro/goal/workout logger!

Come check out my free version of MyfitnessPal, which is valued at $15 a month. 

(This app makes working out fun again... or super serious... whatever YOU need to hold you accountable.)

What makes my app unique? Your macro, workout, and goals that are set, get uploaded to my ChatGPT api, and it critiques your data!

|| IMPORTANT SIDE NOTES: ||

 - The food database is super comprehensive, and has almost all options such as Mcdonalds, Red Lobster, WingStop, Grocery Brands, etc...

 - The barcode manual entry does work, but the actual scanner needs a bit of troubleshooting, and should be working soon.

 - Because this is free, and i'm using a bunch of free tools, if you go to log meals and no one hasn't called the food api in quite a few hours, then it takes 20 seconds or so for the food to populate the screen, but then everything will load quickly after.

 - Email confirmation is off for now, so when you sign up, just enter your information and go straight to login.

 - Because I turned this off, your first task should be 
1) Open settings
2) Fill out settings page, and try to make it fun by doing a custom personality! (save) 
3) Go to macro goals page, and enter your goals
4) Log a meal
5) Head over to AI Coach, and watch your feedback get generated automatically, it will throw you back on track if you are off, or give you appraisal... or make fun of you haha!

6) The goals, and log workout section work as well with ai feedback, I just skipped that for now.


Features to come, and future things to work on: 

1) Push notis to your phone or email after every AI generated coach feedback

2) Share your daily calorie streak goal with friends

3) UI Cleanup

4) Barcode scanner 100% functionality

5) Apple, and Android health API integration, so it automatically subtracts calories from your macro dial, that way you know how many extra cals you need... or don't need.

6) Comprehensive in depth tutorial

7) Imported workout reps/sets from excel format

8) Upload to app stores

My story: I found that personal trainers were very expensive... for reference I had to pay $1,500 for 3 months, and while it did go VERY well... that cost was unsustainable for me. So I then pivot to relying on close friends with similar goals to act as my coach. So we went back and forth sending each other our calories everyday, and it worked, but friends became unreliable, and not too motivating.

- Fast forward to the day I started creating the app... I thought what if I could build an app that AI served as the coach, but gave it unique personalities, OR let users define the personality they want the coach to have... such as pirate, spongebob, robot, etc...

I hope you guys enjoy it
 
 - I would love feedback!
